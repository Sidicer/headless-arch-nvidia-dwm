# Arch Linux Headless Streaming Server (Nvidia)

Configuration to run a fully headless server for **Game** or **Video streaming** which has a remote (virtual) desktop without using a physical dummy connector for GPU or xf86-video-dummy (which doesn't use GPU to render).  
DWM used due to how light-weight it is.

Things that I run personally are:
* [qbittorrent-nox](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/qbittorrent-nox/) (w/ WebUI)
* [jellyfin-server](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=jellyfin-server) (video streaming)
* [sunshine](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sunshine) (game streaming, remote desktop)
* [steam](https://archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/steam/) (big picture)
